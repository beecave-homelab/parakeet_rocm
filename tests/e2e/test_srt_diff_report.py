    # Craft SRTs to exercise various metrics

    """
    Create two sample SRT files (orig.srt and refined.srt) in the given temporary directory to exercise subtitle-quality metrics.
    
    The original SRT contains a very short block, high characters-per-second lines, multiple consecutive lines and an overlap between blocks. The refined SRT removes the overlap but introduces a small butt gap; both files intentionally include remaining minor violations to test detection logic. Files are written as UTF-8.
    
    Returns:
        tuple(Path, Path): Paths to (orig.srt, refined.srt) created in the provided temporary directory.
