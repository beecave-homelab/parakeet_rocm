"""Token-based merging utilities for overlapping ASR chunks.

These helpers are inspired by the MLX implementation and operate purely on
`Word` objects as defined in :pymod:`parakeet_rocm.timestamps.models`.
They are deliberately backend-agnostic so they can be unit-tested without
requiring NeMo or GPU dependencies.

Two strategies are provided:

* ``merge_longest_contiguous`` – fast heuristic that keeps tokens from the first
  chunk up to the midpoint of the *time* overlap and tokens from the second
  chunk after that point. It assumes that token order is correct and simply
  removes duplicates in the overlap zone.
* ``merge_longest_common_subsequence`` – closer match to MLX logic; performs an
  LCS on the *text* (case-insensitive) of the tokens inside the overlap window
  and combines gaps by preferring the longer gap segment.

Both functions accept two pre-sorted token lists and the *overlap duration* in
seconds. They return a **new** merged list (original inputs remain unmodified).

.. note::
   The NeMo RNNT Hypothesis tokens are wordpiece-level and may split words. We
   therefore match on the *normalised token text* rather than integer IDs.
