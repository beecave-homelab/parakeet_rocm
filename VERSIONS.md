## **v0.3.0** - *31-07-2025*

### ✨ **Chunking, Merging & Timestamping Overhaul**

This release introduces a complete overhaul of long-form audio processing, featuring sophisticated chunking and merging strategies to significantly improve transcription accuracy and readability.

### ✨ **New Features**

- **Advanced Chunk Merging**: Added a new `chunking` module with two overlap-aware merging strategies:
  - `lcs`: A text-aware merge using Longest Common Subsequence to produce natural transitions (default).
  - `contiguous`: A faster, simpler merge that stitches segments at the midpoint.
- **FFmpeg Fallback**: Integrated an FFmpeg fallback for robust audio decoding when `soundfile` encounters unsupported formats.
- **New Output Formatters**: Added support for `CSV`, `JSONL`, and `TSV` output formats.

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed**: Cumulative timestamp drift in long audio transcriptions.
  - **Issue**: Successive audio chunks would accumulate small timing errors, causing timestamps to become progressively inaccurate over time.
  - **Root Cause**: The previous merging logic did not account for minor discrepancies in silence detection or token timing at the boundaries of chunks.
  - **Solution**: The new `lcs` merging strategy computes a time offset based on the first aligned token pair in the overlapping region and applies it to the subsequent chunk, ensuring perfect alignment and eliminating drift.

### 🔧 **Improvements**

- **Refactored Transcription Pipeline**: The main `transcribe.py` script was refactored to integrate the new chunking and merging system, controlled via the `--merge-strategy` CLI argument.
- **Enhanced Timestamping**: Word-level timestamp generation is now more accurate due to the improved merging logic.

## **v0.2.2** - *28-07-2025*

### ♻️ **Refactoring & Cleanup**

- **Removed**: Obsolete segmentation helpers `_is_clause_boundary` and `_segment_words` from `timestamps/adapt.py`.
- **Refactored**: Streamlined timestamp adaptation logic to use the new `segment_words` API exclusively.
- **Documentation**: Enhanced README with detailed features and badges.

---

## **v0.2.1** - *27-07-2025*

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes & Style Compliance**

- **Fixed**: Resolved `Unexpected keyword argument` errors by standardizing on `chunk_len_sec` across `app.py` and `transcribe.py`.
- **Fixed**: Corrected a `F841 Local variable ... is assigned to but never used` error in `transcribe.py`.
- **Style**: Enforced strict coding standards across the entire codebase, including Google-style docstrings, PEP 8 compliance, absolute imports, and consistent type hinting.
- **Style**: Corrected constant naming conventions in `utils/env_loader.py`.

## **v0.1.1** - *27-07-2025*

### 🐛 **Bug Fix**

- **Fixed**: Stereo WAV files caused shape mismatch (`[1, T, 2]`) inside NeMo dataloader leading to `TypeError: Output shape mismatch for audio_signal`.
  - **Issue**: `transcribe.py` passed file paths to `model.transcribe()`, which then loaded audio without down-mixing.
  - **Root Cause**: Stereo signals keep channel dimension; model expects mono.
  - **Solution**: `transcribe_paths()` now pre-loads audio, down-mixes to mono and passes numpy waveforms directly, ensuring shape `(time,)`.

### 🔧 **Improvements in v0.1.1**

- Always converts input audio to mono automatically; users no longer need to pre-process.
