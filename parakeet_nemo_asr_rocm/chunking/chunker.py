"""Sliding-window chunker for long-audio transcription.

This module provides utilities to split long mono waveforms into overlapping
windows and later restore global timestamps by offsetting NeMo hypotheses.
Further merge helpers will be added in follow-up iterations.

The logic is intentionally kept free of any NeMo or torch imports so that it
can be reused for offline testing without GPU dependencies.
